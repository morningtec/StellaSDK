 *	Functions for debugging object allocation/deallocation
 *
 *	Internal functions:
 *	GSDebugAllocationAdd()		is used by NSAllocateObject()
 *	GSDebugAllocationRemove()	is used by NSDeallocateObject()
 *
 *	Public functions:
 *	GSDebugAllocationActive()	
 *	GSDebugAllocationCount()	
 *      GSDebugAllocationTotal()
 *      GSDebugAllocationPeak()
 *      GSDebugAllocationClassList()
 *	GSDebugAllocationList()
 *	GSDebugAllocationListAll()
 * GSSetDebugAllocationFunctions()
 *
 * When the previous functions have allowed you to find a memory leak,
 * and you know that you are leaking objects of class XXX, but you are
 * hopeless about actually finding out where the leak is, the
 * following functions could come handy as they allow you to find
 * exactly *what* objects you are leaking (warning! these functions
 * could slow down your system appreciably - use them only temporarily
 * and only in debugging systems):
 *
 *  GSDebugAllocationActiveRecordingObjects()
 *  GSDebugAllocationListRecordedObjects()
