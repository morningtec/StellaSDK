Place in this directory things that are experimental.

And by experimental I mean:
  * features that needs more testing. eg: something that breaks compatibility
  * features that are not complete. eg: Actions that don't support reverse, the don't look good, needs more polish, etc.
  * features that have important bugs. eg: memory leaks

Think of this place like a playground, to test some ideas that you think it might
benefit other users.
