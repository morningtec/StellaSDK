File: EAGLView.h
Abstract: This class wraps the CAEAGLLayer from CoreAnimation into a convenient
UIView subclass. The view content is basically an EAGL surface you render your
OpenGL scene into.  Note that setting the view non-opaque will only work if the
EAGL surface has an alpha channel.

Version: 1.8
